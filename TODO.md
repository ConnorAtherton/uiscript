# TODO

- Improve parsing errors. We could show the exact code position instead of printing the line
  and character information.
- Better examples
- Tests
- Add support for inline comments
- Add a watch flag for the cli tool
- Use `buildTransformPipeline` in the runner to add minification
- Chained sequence animations (doc/sequences.md)
- Support `in` keyword for delays: `toggle 'class' on 'elements' in '200ms'`
